GMM_Aeros_V1：The research constructs an empirical model using a mixed-effects algorithm to forecast peak ground motion parameters, including peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, and spectral acceleration ordinates at periods between 0.02 to 2.0 s. The model utilizes key input parameters for prediction, including moment magnitude (Mw), Joyner-Boore distance (RJB), and focal depth (FD). The model is formulated for shallow seismic events ranging from magnitude Mw 5.0 to 6.8, FD 5 to 17 km, and RJB up to 150 km in bedrock.
